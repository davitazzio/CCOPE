# Proxy Provider
## Overview

`proxy-provider` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider designed to orchestrate data traffic routing in distributed IoT environments, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and cross-system compatibility.

The provider is capable of offloading and routing a specific subset of messages generated by an IoT system toward remote clusters. It monitors system load and resilience, bridging the gap between broker instances and consumers that may rely on disparate technologies.

### Key Features

* **Cross-Cluster Traffic Offloading:** Dynamically routes IoT telemetry to remote clusters to prevent local bottlenecks.
* **Protocol & Technology Bridging:** Enables seamless communication between different messaging technologies (e.g., MQTT and Kafka).
* **Fault Tolerance:** Enhances system reliability by providing alternative data paths in case of cluster-specific failures.
* **Load Balancing:** Communicates directly with brokers to optimally distribute the workload across the infrastructure.


### Managed Resources: EMQX-Kafka Proxy

In this implementation, the provider introduces the `emqx-kafka-proxy` Custom Resource (CRD). This resource manages the integration between an **EMQX-based MQTT proxy** and a **Kafka broker**.

It is specifically designed to:
1.  Forward queued messages from an EMQX instance to a Kafka cluster.
2.  Maintain system consistency during the handover between the two protocols.
3.  Implement intelligent balancing strategies to ensure neither the MQTT ingress nor the Kafka egress becomes a point of congestion.
